# üß™ Twitter Misinformation Community Analysis

## üìä Data Analysis & Results

### 1. Community Detection via Content Similarity

Using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity on tweet content, a similarity graph was constructed where nodes represent tweets and edges connect tweets with high textual similarity (threshold: 0.2). Louvain community detection was then applied to identify clusters of similar tweets.

- **Total tweets analyzed**: 12,900
- **Communities detected**: 33

*The visualization above shows the network of tweets where color indicates community membership. Tweets within the same community are semantically similar and form dense clusters.*

### 2. Misinformation Distribution Across Communities

We evaluated the prevalence of misinformation across detected communities using provided tweet labels (`Reliable` vs `Misinformation`).

- **Key finding**: Several communities are dominated by misinformation content.

#### üìå Figure 2: Misinformation Ratio by Community

*This chart reveals the proportion of misinformation within each community. A high ratio suggests strong misinformation presence.*

#### üîù Top 10 Communities by Misinformation Ratio:

```
label      Misinformation  Reliable  misinfo_ratio
community                                         
16                    1.0       0.0            1.0
8                     1.0       0.0            1.0
23                    1.0       0.0            1.0
18                    1.0       0.0            1.0
17                    1.0       0.0            1.0
15                    1.0       0.0            1.0
14                    1.0       0.0            1.0
12                    1.0       0.0            1.0
32                    1.0       0.0            1.0
7                     1.0       0.0            1.0
```

This polarization indicates **echo chambers**, where certain clusters heavily propagate only misinformation or reliable content with minimal crossover.

### 3. Semantic Structure in 2D (PCA)

To better understand tweet groupings, dimensionality reduction via PCA was applied.

*Tweets are grouped in 2D space based on semantic similarity. Color represents the community assignment.*

#### üìå Figure 4: Tweet Distribution by Label (PCA)

*This plot shows how Reliable and Misinformation tweets are distributed across semantic space. The partial separation indicates thematic divergence between the two.*

### 4. Top Communities by Size

The following are the 10 largest communities by number of tweets:

```
28    2756
5     1919
11    1791
13    1410
26    1238
10     941
3      685
1      664
25     585
30     307
```

## üß† Interpretation

This analysis demonstrates how **content similarity + community detection** reveals the **underlying structure of discourse** on Twitter:

- Communities form **naturally around shared narratives**.
- Misinformation tends to **concentrate** in certain clusters ‚Äî validating theories of **information silos** and **filter bubbles**.
- This pipeline enables scalable misinformation mapping across large-scale social media data.
